#### Verified Tables

```text
public | audit_logs         | table | teamvault
public | credentials        | table | teamvault  
public | one_time_links     | table | teamvault
public | refresh_tokens     | table | teamvault
public | shared_credentials | table | teamvault
public | team_memberships   | table | teamvault
public | teams              | table | teamvault
public | users              | table | teamvault
```

### 🚀 Next Development Steps

### 🔧 Issues Resolved

#### 1. Frontend Crypto Error (RESOLVED ✅)

- **Issue**: `crypto.hash is not a function` in Vite
- **Solution**: Updated Node.js to v20-alpine with build dependencies
- **Status**: Frontend running without errors

#### 2. Backend Prisma OpenSSL Error (RESOLVED ✅)

- **Issue**: `SSL_get_peer_certificate: symbol not found`
- **Solution**: Switched from Alpine to Debian-based `node:20-slim` image
- **Status**: Backend running without errors

#### 3. Database Initialization (RESOLVED ✅)

- **Issue**: `The table public.users does not exist`
- **Solution**: Created initial migration with `prisma migrate dev --name init`
- **Status**: All database operations functional

### 📁 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Start the environment
docker-compose up -d

# Initialize database (if needed)
docker-compose exec backend npx prisma migrate dev --name init

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop environment
docker-compose down
```

### 🎯 Next Steps

The development environment is fully operational. You can now:

1. **Develop Features**: Add new functionality to frontend/backend
2. **Test API Endpoints**: Use the running backend at <http://localhost:3000>
3. **UI Development**: Frontend is ready at <http://localhost:5173>
4. **Database Operations**: All Prisma operations are working
5. **Email Testing**: Use MailHog at <http://localhost:8025>
