## 🎯 Project Purpose

**Team Vault** is a secure, web-based credential management platform designed to eliminate the security risks associated with sharing sensitive information through insecure channels. The platform provides teams with a centralized, encrypted repository for storing, organizing, and sharing credentials with granular access controls and intelligent lifecycle management.

### 🚀 Mission Statement

*"To provide teams with a secure, user-friendly platform that eliminates credential sharing risks while maintaining productivity and collaboration efficiency."*

## 🚨 Problem Statement

### Current Challenges

#### 🔓 **Insecure Sharing Practices**

- Teams frequently share passwords, API keys, and sensitive credentials through:
  - Chat platforms (Slack, Teams, Discord)
  - Email
  - Shared documents (Google Docs, Word files)
  - Text messages
  - Unencrypted note-taking apps

#### 📊 **Lack of Visibility & Control**

- No centralized way to track who has access to what credentials
- Inability to revoke access when team members leave
- No audit trail of credential usage
- Difficulty in managing credential lifecycles

#### ⏰ **Manual & Error-Prone Processes**

- Manual credential rotation processes
- No automated expiration tracking
- Forgotten credentials leading to service disruptions
- Inconsistent security practices across teams

#### 🏢 **Organizational Risks**

- Compliance violations due to poor credential management
- Security breaches from exposed credentials
- Productivity loss from locked-out services
- Difficulty onboarding/offboarding team members

### 📈 **Impact of These Problems**

| Problem Area | Business Impact | Security Risk | Productivity Impact |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Insecure Sharing** | High | Critical | Medium |
| **No Access Control** | High | High | High |
| **Manual Processes** | Medium | Medium | High |
