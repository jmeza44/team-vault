## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### **Encryption Specifications**
- **Algorithm:** AES-256-CBC 
- **Key Derivation:** PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations using SHA-256
- **Salt:** 32 bytes (256 bits) - unique per credential
- **IV:** 16 bytes (128 bits) - unique per encryption operation
- **Storage Format:** Base64-encoded (salt + iv + encrypted_data)

### **API Endpoint Summary**
```typescript
GET    /api/credentials              // List credentials with filters
GET    /api/credentials/:id          // Get credential with decrypted secret
POST   /api/credentials              // Create new credential
PATCH  /api/credentials/:id          // Update credential
DELETE /api/credentials/:id          // Delete credential
POST   /api/credentials/:id/share    // Share credential
POST   /api/credentials/:id/one-time-link  // Create one-time link
```

### **Frontend Component Architecture**
```
pages/credentials/
├── CredentialsPage.tsx         // Main page with state management
└── components/credentials/
    ├── CredentialForm.tsx      // Create/Edit form
    ├── CredentialCard.tsx      // Grid view item
    └── CredentialDetailModal.tsx // Full view modal
services/
└── credentialService.ts        // API communication
```
